# Galerie Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 2026*

We built Galerie to help people enjoy art on their own devices — not to collect your data. This policy explains what we do and don't do with your information.

## Definitions


**Your Art** — Images and artwork you make available to the Galerie application from your personal photo library or other sources you control.

**Museum Art** — Artwork and related information accessed through museum and website APIs (for example, images, titles, artists, and descriptions provided by museums and cultural institutions).

**Art Styles** — Categories, movements, subjects, museum sources, aesthetic categories, or other groupings used to organize and describe artwork (for example, "Impressionism," "Abstract Expressionism," or "Landscapes").

**Community Ratings** — Ratings, preferences, or feedback that you and other Galerie users provide about Museum Art and Art Styles.

**App Analytics** — Anonymous, technical data about how the app is performing. This includes crash reports, bug diagnostics, memory and CPU usage, screen load times, network latency, error logs, device types, OS versions, usability issues (such as unresponsive UI elements or failed user actions), aggregate feature usage counts, and other application related performance measures.

## What We Promise

### Your Art never leaves your device

Your Art stays within your iCloud account. We never upload, transfer, copy, or store Your Art on our servers. The app works with Your Art on your devices and within your iCloud account.  

### Art Styles

We categorize Your Art on to help you discover your art through the Galarie interface.  Your Art's styles remain within your devices and your iCloud account.

### We never collect direct or indirect identifiers about you

We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, physical address, IP address, device ID, or any other information that directly or indirectly identifies who you are. 

### Community Ratings are never tied to you

When you submit a Community Rating, it is stored anonymously. We have no way to connect a rating back to you. Ratings exist only as part of the broader community's collective feedback.

### Community Ratings

We collect Community Ratings regarding Museum Art and Art Styles to help surface artwork and styles that the community finds interesting. These ratings are anonymous — they are not linked to any individual user.

### App Analytics

We collect anonymous App Analytics to help us find and fix problems and improve the app experience. This includes things like crash reports, error logs, memory and CPU usage, screen load times, network latency, usability issues, and how often features are used. None of this data will be attribuited to you.

## What We Share

### Community Ratings

We use and share Community Ratings across the Galerie community to help the community discover art that is more relevant to their interests. Since ratings are anonymous, nothing shared can be traced back to any individual user.

### Nothing else

We do not sell or rent any data with third parties.
